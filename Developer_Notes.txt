Hey,

  After reading the problem statement I wanted the new feature related to COVID to be plug and play thing.
  So I have created IRentalHelperService Interface and following class implements it.

   1] BasicRentalHelperService:
                          Contains logic without COVID features , basically Assigement with refatoring 
						  
   2] COVIDFunctionalityRentalHelperService:
                          Contains the new feature implemention and will work with previous scenarios too.
          
		I have registered this service in Startup.cs
        In future we want to remove new feature then we can register BasicRentalHelperService instead of this one

   ## The tasks completed

   1]    
        a] preparation time   =>  done
		b] calender           =>  done
		
   2]    Improved readability, maintainability.     
         Unit Test :  added working test cases in VacationRental.Api.Tests\COVIDTests
		 
   3]	 PUT call for Rental  => done 

       Please let me know if any queries.
